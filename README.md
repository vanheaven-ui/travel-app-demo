## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Optimization
This project follows modern best practices for performance, structure, and maintainability:

- Modular Architecture
Code organized under src/app, src/components, src/hooks, and src/types.

- Custom Hooks (useTravelData)
Encapsulates filtering, pagination, and fetching logic for reuse and clarity.

- Next.js App Router
Leverages the latest routing system for clean URLs and built-in server components.

- Server Components
PlaceDetailPage uses async server rendering for faster performance and improved SEO.

- Client Components
Interactive pages like HomePage use "use client" for client-side interactivity.

- next/image Optimization
Automatic image optimization with proper layout fill, lazy loading, and remote image config.

- Performance Hooks (useMemo)
Optimizes render cycles by memoizing computed values and filtered results.

- Full TypeScript Coverage
Strong typing across components, hooks, and utilities.

- Tailwind CSS
Efficient utility-based styling with responsive, dark mode-ready classes.

- next.config.js Tweaks
Uses reactStrictMode, swcMinify, and output: 'standalone' for deployment readiness.
